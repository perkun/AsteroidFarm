# SAGE

Asteroid shape modelling method based on genetic algorithm. The original paper describing the method
can be found [here](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/473/4/5050/4657825). The method itself
has evolved since. This repository is an attempt to rewrite and unify all the bits and pieces of
code written throughout the years while developing the method.
