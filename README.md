# SAGE

Asteroid shape modelling method based on genetic algorithm. The original paper describing the method
can be found [here](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/473/4/5050/4657825). The method itself
has evolved since. The aim of this project is to collect bits of software written throughout the
years of developing the method, unify, rewrite and better them, and finally glue everything together
with modern C++.
