# About

This project is a collection of algorithms and utilities useful for asteroid shape modeling. The aim
is to collect ideas developed throughout the years of working on asteroid shape models and to
deliver a coherent software package using modern C++.

Additional aim is to unify and  rewrite the code for the **SAGE** method. **SAGE** stands for
Shaping Asteroids with Genetic Evolution, and is an inversion technique for asteroid shape modeling.
Taking lightcurves, adaptive optics images (*TODO*: stellar occultation cords and radar delay-Doppler
images) the method creates 3D shape models and spin state (spin axis orientation and period) of an
asteroid best explaining the data. Original paper describing the method can be found
[here](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/473/4/5050/4657825).

## Features
