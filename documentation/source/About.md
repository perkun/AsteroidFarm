# About SAGE and this project

**SAGE** stands for Shaping Asteroids with Genetic Evolution, and is an inversion technique for
asteroid shape modeling. Taking lightcurves, adaptive optics images, stellar occultation cords or
radar delay-Doppler images the method creates 3D shape models and spin state (spin axis orientation
and period) of an asteroid best explaining the data. Original paper describing the method can be
found [here](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/473/4/5050/4657825).

The aim of this project is to collect bits of software written throughout the years of developing
the method, unify, rewrite and better them, and finally glue everything together with modern C++.
